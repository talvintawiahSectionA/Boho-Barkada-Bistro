# Boho Barkada Bistro Website - README

## Welcome to the Digital Haven of Boho Barkada Bistro!

This project is dedicated to crafting the official website for Boho Barkada Bistro, Toronto's soon-to-be urban rustic haven. Our aim is to build a vibrant online space that captures the essence of the bistro: a delightful fusion of bohemian spirit, the warmth of close friendships ("Barkada"), and a love for delectable food.

## A Glimpse into our Digital Bistro:

- **Community Corner:** We'll cultivate a sense of belonging by showcasing photos and stories that celebrate friendship and connection.
- **Culinary Delights on Display:** Mouthwatering food photography and a clear menu will entice visitors and showcase the bistro's culinary offerings.
- **User-Friendly Experience:** A user-friendly interface will ensure easy navigation, with online reservation capabilities (if desired) and clear contact information.
